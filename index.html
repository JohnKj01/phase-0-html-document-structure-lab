      Developing a good website is like cutting hair. When you are almost done,
      you find a few areas that you can improve. It is not about the end
      product, but the fancy journey you go through to get where you get.The
      same mentality can be attributed to everybody who has ever made a
      substancial contribution to the modern science and technology eg henry
      ford, Nikola Tesla, Edward Jenner,Bill Gates, Elon, Mark among others
